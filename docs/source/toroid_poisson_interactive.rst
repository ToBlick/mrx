This script solves a Poisson problem on a toroidal domain interactively.
The script is located at ``scripts/interactive/toroid_poisson.py``.

The script demonstrates:

- Setting up finite element spaces on a toroidal domain
- Solving Poisson equations in toroidal geometry
- Interactive visualization of results

Usage:

.. code-block:: bash
