Cylinder Cavity
===============

This script solves eigenvalue problems for a cylindrical cavity.
The script is located at ``scripts/interactive/cylinder_cavity.py``.

The script demonstrates:

- Computing eigenvalues and eigenmodes for cylindrical cavities
- Visualizing eigenmodes
- Analyzing cavity resonances

Usage:

.. code-block:: bash

    python scripts/interactive/cylinder_cavity.py

The script generates plots showing eigenvalues and eigenmode visualizations.
