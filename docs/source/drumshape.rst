Drum Shape Optimization
========================

This script demonstrates shape optimization for drum-like configurations.
The script is located at ``scripts/interactive/drumshape.py``.

The script demonstrates:

- Shape optimization using finite element methods
- Target shape reconstruction
- Iterative optimization algorithms

Usage:

.. code-block:: bash

    python scripts/interactive/drumshape.py

The script generates plots showing the optimization progress and final shape.

Full script:

.. literalinclude:: ../../scripts/interactive/drumshape.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
